Hash Code 2020
==============

This is a solution for Google's [Hash Code 2020
competition](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/hashcode).

The Experience
--------------

This is my first coding competition as I've never had the urge to try
it. But a friend wanted to try it so we formed a two member team and
decided to have fun.

There isn't a lot of time: 4h to read and understand the problem, write
the code, submit it and iterate on the idea.

The code produces the final score of 22.709.246 points. For comparison,
the winner of 4 hours of competition produces 27.203.691 points.

All in all, we had fun :)

The Code and Data
-----------------

Written using latest Python 3 at the time (3.8.1), but any could be
easily modified to run on any python.

A single input file can be processed with:

    ./books.py input-file > output-file

Run all input files with:

    ./runall.sh

which will process all input files from `data` directory and write
result files to `output`.

The Team
--------

1. Igor LuliÄ‡ - the math guy
2. Sasha Matijasic - me, the coding guy
